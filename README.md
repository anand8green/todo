• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing
your solution?

- I used React functional component to create reusuble component to show each to-do-task group.

• Briefly explain your technical design and why do you think is the best
approach to this problem.

- Reusuable code that are easy to maintaned. User-experience will be same across all the products. Easy to maintain the products - any issue with component found in one product would be fixed automatically for all the products.

• If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would
you have liked to implement them.
